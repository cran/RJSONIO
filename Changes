RJSONIO

Version 0.3-0

   * Added facility to basicJSONHandler() to avoid simplifying lists into vectors.
     Thanks to Kevin Coombes for bring the issue to my attention.

Version 0.2-4

  *  Handles UTF-8 content  as input. We convert the text to raw and then integer
values.



Version 0.2-3

  *  (Minor) Change to the C code to make it compile on Windows.



Version 0.2-2

  *  named atomic/primitive vectors serialized as associative arrays rather
than simple arrays.



Version 0.2-1

  *  names on R objects from associative arrays from JSON were in reverse order.



Version 0.2-0

  *  Scalar, by default, values are represented in JSON as scalars and not
arrays of length 1.  One can control this via the
container parameter in toJSON().
